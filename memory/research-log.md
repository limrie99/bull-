## 2026-05-28 08:32 CT — market-open

### Coming back online after a 5-week halt
- API keys are restored. Alpaca clock confirms market is open (`is_open: true`, next_close 2026-05-28 16:00 ET).
- Account snapshot: equity $99,840.95, cash $99,840.95, 0 positions, 0 open orders, daytrade_count 0.
- **Memory was out of sync with Alpaca.** Trade-log and portfolio.md showed "no trades yet" but Alpaca order history shows the 4/22 NVDA starter actually executed (buy 25 @ $201.38, OTO with a -7% stop @ $187.28). The bracket stop's day-TIF leg expired EOD 4/22; a fresh GTC stop was re-placed 4/23. On 4/27 it was swapped for a 10% trailing stop. The trailing stop fired 5/4 @ $195.0184 after NVDA peaked at $216.73 (high water mark in the order record). Net P/L: -$159.04 (-3.16%).
- Reconciled retroactively: appended both NVDA legs to `memory/trade-log.md` and updated `memory/portfolio.md` with the close.

### Market context (light pull — full scout deferred to next pre-market)
- SPY $750.03 right now (5/28 mid-morning). 5/22 close $745.67 → week-to-date **+0.59%**. 4/22 open $709.14 → since-inception **+5.77%**.
- Tape has clearly been **risk-on** during our offline window — SPY ground steadily higher (711 → 750) with low daily vol.
- No fresh news / macro / earnings pull done this routine. The 4/22 pre-market plan is **stale (35 trading days old)**. Strategy says do not propose without verification — so no buys today.

### Portfolio watch
None — flat.

### Buy candidates
**None executed.** No fresh pre-market scout for today's open. Per strategy ("fundamentals-driven", "do not propose without verification"), I am NOT initiating positions off a 5-week-old plan or off price action alone. The right move is to run a proper pre-market scout for tomorrow's (Friday 5/29) open or, more usefully, for Tuesday 6/2 open since Monday looks like a long-weekend re-open (note: 5/26 Memorial Day already passed — Friday 5/29 is a regular trading day).

### Sell candidates
None — no positions.

### Performance read since inception
- Account: -0.16% in 5 weeks.
- SPY: +5.77% same window.
- **Alpha: -5.93%.** That's a real hole. It came from one round-trip that captured ~half of an NVDA move on the way up but gave back the rest, AND from being out of the tape entirely for 4 weeks while SPY ran. The lesson is uptime: when a routine halts on missing keys, we lose both ways — we don't manage risk on open positions AND we miss new setups.

### Plan into tomorrow / next routine
1. Today: midday/close routines should just monitor — no new entries without a real scout.
2. Pre-market scout for 5/29 open (or whichever is the next scheduled pre-market routine): run the 3-sub-agent fan-out (macro, earnings, opportunity), build a fresh 6–10 name watchlist, confirm earnings dates, and propose a properly verified starter only if ≥2 buy signals are met.
3. **Note for the weekly review:** raise this with the user — should we tighten the routine to "if memory is more than 3 trading days stale, force a fresh pre-market scout before any execution routine can place an order"? Right now there's no built-in guardrail for stale-research execution.

## 2026-04-22 12:00 CT — midday (HALTED)

### Halt reason
Same as this morning's market-open: `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, `ALPACA_BASE_URL`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` all empty and no `./.env`. Per CLAUDE.md guardrail, halted before any API call.

### No actions taken
- No Alpaca calls (positions, prices, orders, stop-management).
- No Perplexity news-check on any drawdown (there's no live positions data to know if there's a drawdown anyway).
- No new buys (moot — can't confirm price, daily-loss cap, or position count without Alpaca).
- Portfolio unchanged: assumed still $100K cash / 0 positions from 2026-04-21 19:00 CT.

### Pattern note
Second halt in a row (market-open 08:30 also halted for the same reason). If this keeps up through market-close, the whole 4/22 session is a no-op — fine, since we have no open risk, but the user needs to restore secrets before any routine can actually trade.

### Next steps
Once secrets are set: run a fresh pre-market-style scout before executing the old NVDA starter plan. Don't trade off last night's context — tape will have moved.

---

## 2026-04-22 08:30 CT — market-open (HALTED)

### Halt reason
Required env vars missing: `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, `ALPACA_BASE_URL`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`. No `./.env` file and no env vars set in the cloud environment. Per CLAUDE.md guardrail ("If a required var is empty, halt, write a clear error to `memory/messages.md`, and stop"), aborted before any API call.

### No actions taken
- No Alpaca calls (clock, account, positions, orders).
- No Perplexity calls.
- Portfolio snapshot unchanged (no live data to refresh it with). Paper account assumed still $100K cash / 0 positions from last known state.
- Planned NVDA starter ($5K) from last night's scout re-run is deferred — will need a fresh pre-market re-validation once secrets are back, since "if futures risk-off, pass" was part of the plan and we have no way to check futures from this routine.

### Next steps
Once secrets are set, the next routine (midday-check or next pre-market) should re-scout — don't blindly execute last night's NVDA plan on stale context.

## 2026-04-21 19:00 CT — pre-market (for 2026-04-22 open) — re-run

**Timing note:** Second pass for the Wed 4/22 open, after the 17:00 CT pass flagged too many `n/a`s to act on. APIs verified live (Alpaca 200, Perplexity 200). Three sub-agents fanned out in parallel — macro, earnings, opportunity scout. Account unchanged: $100K cash, 0 positions.

### Market context
Tape shifted **mildly risk-off** vs the earlier bullish futures read.
- **ES (Jun'26):** ~7,165.75, **−0.13%** evening session (was ~+0.35% at 17:00 CT — faded).
- **NQ (Jun'26):** ~flat to +0.05% evening.
- **US 10Y Treasury:** 4.294%, **+4.4 bps** on the day (range 4.236 – 4.319). Bonds sold off.
- **Crude:** direction up on "Iran concerns" headlines; WTI/Brent exact levels `n/a`.
- **DXY, Nikkei, Hang Seng, European closes:** `n/a` — Perplexity sparse on these; not actionable.
- **Headline flow:** Iran/Middle East risk premium flipped the intraday tone — early equity gains erased, crude spiked, rates up. No Fed speaker, CPI/PPI, or tariff print surfaced in this window.
- **Net:** mildly risk-off. Iran/oil is the live wire. Secondary watch: does 10Y hold above 4.30% at Wed open.

### Portfolio watch
No open positions. $100K cash, $200K buying power (cash-only / no leverage per strategy).

### Earnings calendar (2026-04-22)
Contradicts the 17:00 CT pass — worth flagging.
- **Fresh Perplexity (sonar-pro) returned no confirmed $10B+ US earnings for 4/22, BMO or AMC.** Names that *may* report BMO per an Interactive Investor preview dated 4/17 (unconfirmed for 4/22 specifically): **MMM, GE, UNH, EL, XOM, MRNA**. Consensus EPS/rev not supplied.
- **TSLA AMC 4/22** was asserted in the 17:00 CT pass but was NOT confirmed in tonight's fresh pull. Source contradiction — do not treat TSLA as a confirmed tape-setter until verified tomorrow morning.
- **4/21 AMC mega-cap prints (MSFT / GOOGL / META / AMZN / NVDA):** none reported per tonight's pull.
- **Guidance-risk call:** low-conviction — with no confirmed mega-cap print, Wednesday is more likely to be macro-driven (Iran / rates) than earnings-driven.

### Buy candidates

Scout verified next-earnings dates on 3 of 10 seed names; the rest came back `n/a` on critical fields — strategy says do not propose without verification. Documenting honestly.

- **NVDA — AI-infra leader, clean earnings runway.** Signals: (3) secular AI-infra tailwind (Blackwell ramp, cap-ex cycle). Next earnings **2026-05-20 AMC (confirmed)** — ~21 trading days out, outside the 3-day blackout. **Conviction: med.** Only 1 hard signal verified tonight; the earnings date is inbound catalyst but not near-term. Prefer a pullback entry; do not chase.
- **AVGO — AI ASIC/networking play, widest earnings window.** Signals: (3) custom-silicon + VMware AI tailwind. Next earnings **2026-06-03 (confirmed)** — 6+ weeks out. **Conviction: low–med.** Single verified signal; would upgrade with a verified upgrade or insider-buy tomorrow.
- **PLTR — AI/defense software, earnings in 9 trading days.** Signals: (3) AI + gov tailwind. Next earnings **2026-05-04 AMC (confirmed)** — 9 trading days out (clear of 3-day blackout but close). **Conviction: low.** High multiple risk into the print; any entry now must be size-to-trim-before-5/1 OR hold-through willingness.
- **GOOGL, MSFT, CRWD, PANW, BE, LLY, NOW** — earnings dates and fresh catalysts unverified in tonight's 3 Perplexity calls. **MSFT and GOOGL historically print late April** — treat as likely inside/adjacent 3-day blackout until a date is confirmed. **Do not open GOOGL or MSFT at Wed open without an explicit earnings-date check.**

**Net:** no clean ≥2-signal-verified buy tonight. **NVDA is the only name with verified runway + a real tailwind.** Strategy explicitly prefers patience; recommend at most a **starter tranche (1/3 of target size, ~5% of portfolio ≈ $5K)** in NVDA at Wed open IF macro tone is constructive, and re-run the scout after tomorrow night's close with a better-pulled watchlist. If pre-open futures are still risk-off (ES < flat, 10Y > 4.30, WTI gapped up), **pass entirely.**

### Sell candidates
None — no positions.

### Notes / research gaps to close next routine
1. Verify TSLA 4/22 AMC print — source contradiction between 17:00 and 19:00 CT passes.
2. Pull MSFT and GOOGL next-earnings dates explicitly (likely inside late-April blackout window).
3. Get WTI/Brent cash levels and DXY at open — macro still has too many `n/a`s to size rate-sensitive names.
4. Perplexity sonar-pro with low search context was thin tonight. Consider raising context size for the scout call (`search_context_size: "medium"`) if budget allows — but batch tickers to keep the call count down.

## 2026-04-21 17:00 CT — pre-market (for 2026-04-22 open)

**Timing note:** Routine fired ad-hoc, not at scheduled 6:00 AM CT slot. Alpaca clock confirms market closed; next_open = 2026-04-22 09:30 ET. Treating this as pre-market prep for Wednesday's session. Account is fresh ($100K cash, no positions) — this is Bull's first research pass.

### Market context
Mildly **risk-on** into Wed 4/22 open, low conviction.
- **ES ~+0.35%, NQ ~+0.05 to +0.40%** late Tuesday (E-mini S&P/Nasdaq). Earlier-session weakness (-0.4%) faded on Mid-East peace-deal progress headlines.
- **Dominant narrative:** US–Iran / Middle East de-escalation hopes lifting futures. Oil moves are the swing factor — a re-spike would flip sentiment to mixed.
- **Data gaps:** Perplexity returned n/a for 10Y yield, DXY, WTI/Brent levels, and Asia/Europe indices. Not confident on rate direction — avoid sizing up rate-sensitive names until a fresh cash-session print.
- No Fed commentary, CPI/PPI, tariff, or mega-cap earnings surprise surfaced since Tuesday's close.

### Portfolio watch
No open positions. Nothing to watch. $100K cash, $200K buying power (2× margin, but strategy is cash-only / no leverage).

### Earnings calendar (2026-04-22)
- **BMO:** BSX (Boston Scientific) — consensus EPS ~$0.555. Watch Farapulse / PFA adoption, Watchman utilization, hospital capex commentary. Med-tech tone-setter.
- **AMC:** TSLA — consensus EPS ~$2.61, revenue ~$10.81B (directional — source numbers were noisy). Key watches: auto gross margin ex-credits, delivery trajectory, Optimus / FSD / robotaxi commentary, AI infra capex. Biggest single tape-setter for Thursday sentiment.
- **Calendar unconfirmed:** IBM, T, NOW, CMG, LRCX, GD are commonly on this slate historically — sub-agent could not verify. Cross-reference needed before treating as tradeable.
- **Post-close 4/21 reports:** data thin; no confirmed mega-cap AMC prints to front-run tomorrow.

### Buy candidates

Research pass was sparse — two Perplexity calls yielded only one fully specified candidate, and that one is blocked by strategy rules. Documenting the state honestly rather than forcing low-conviction picks.

- **AMZN (~$205, ~$2.2T mcap)** — Signals hit: (3) secular AI/AWS tailwind; partial (1) Q4 beat with AWS +24% YoY. Next earnings ~2026-04-30. **EXCLUDED** — inside the 3-trading-day earnings window per strategy rule. Revisit post-print on May 1.
- **BE (Bloom Energy)** — Signals (6) strong uptrend, (3) fuel-cells-for-AI-data-center narrative. Earnings date unverified. **LOW/MED conviction**, catalyst is generic. Needs a verified earnings date and a specific near-term catalyst (contract announcement, capacity expansion) before entering.
- **CAR (Avis)** — Up ~+382% in 30 days per scout. **SKIP.** Momentum-alone, no catalyst, smells short-squeeze / meme-adjacent. Strategy explicitly forbids.
- **NVDA, AVGO, PLTR, GOOGL, CRWD, PANW** — scout returned n/a on critical fields (catalysts, earnings dates, current price confirms). Insufficient to propose. Next pre-market routine should pull NVDA/AVGO earnings dates directly from Alpaca and query Perplexity more narrowly.

**Net:** no high-conviction buy for 4/22 open from this scan. Better to wait and do a better-focused scan tomorrow than to force a mediocre entry on Bull's first trade.

### Sell candidates
None — no positions.

### Notes / research gaps to close next routine
1. Get actual 10Y yield, DXY, WTI, Brent levels at open — macro digest had too many n/a's.
2. Pull next-earnings dates directly from Alpaca calendar API before asking Perplexity for thesis — avoids wasting calls.
3. Build a small seed watchlist (NVDA, AVGO, GOOGL, MSFT, PLTR, CRWD, PANW, BE, LLY, NOW) so the opportunity scout has a concrete set to research rather than fishing open-universe.
